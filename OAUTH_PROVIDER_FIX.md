# OAuth Provider Issue Fix

## Problem Description

The application had an issue where users who registered with email/password (provider = "local") would have their provider overwritten to "google" when they later logged in with Google OAuth using the same email address. This caused problems with password change functionality.

### Root Cause

In `CustomOAuth2UserService.java`, when a user with an existing local account logged in via Google OAuth, the code would:

1. Find the user by email
2. Link the Google ID to the account
3. **Overwrite the provider to "google"** ← This was the problem
4. Save the user

This meant users could no longer change their password because the system thought they were Google-only users.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Preserve Original Provider

Modified `CustomOAuth2UserService.java` to **not change the provider** when linking a Google account to an existing local account:

```java
// Before (problematic):
user.setProvider("google");

// After (fixed):
// Don't change the provider - keep it as "local" to preserve password functionality
// user.setProvider("google"); // ← Removed this line
```

### 2. Enhanced User Model

Added helper methods to `User.java` to better handle multiple authentication methods:

- `hasPasswordAuthentication()` - Check if user has a password set
- `hasGoogleAuthentication()` - Check if user has Google ID linked
- `canUsePasswordAuthentication()` - Check if user can use password login
- `hasMultipleAuthenticationMethods()` - Check if user has both auth methods
- `getPrimaryAuthenticationMethod()` - Get the primary auth method

### 3. Improved Change Password Controller

Updated `ChangePasswordController.java` to:

- Use the new helper methods
- Provide better information about authentication status
- Ensure provider is set to "local" when setting/changing password
- Handle users with multiple authentication methods

### 4. Enhanced UI

Updated `change-password.html` template to:

- Show clear authentication method status
- Indicate which methods are available
- Provide guidance for users with multiple auth methods
- Show whether password authentication is active or inactive

### 5. Added Logging

Added comprehensive logging to `CustomOAuth2UserService.java` to help with debugging and monitoring the authentication linking process.

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: New User with Google OAuth
1. User clicks "Login with Google"
2. New account created with `provider = "google"`
3. User can only use Google authentication

### Scenario 2: Existing Local User + Google OAuth
1. User previously registered with email/password (`provider = "local"`)
2. User clicks "Login with Google" with same email
3. System finds existing account by email
4. **Google ID is linked but provider remains "local"** ← Key fix
5. User can now use both password and Google authentication
6. Password change functionality remains available

### Scenario 3: Returning Google User
1. User who previously used Google OAuth returns
2. System finds account by Google ID
3. Normal login proceeds

## Benefits

1. **Preserves Password Functionality**: Users who originally registered with email/password can still change their password
2. **Multiple Authentication Methods**: Users can have both password and Google authentication
3. **Better User Experience**: Clear indication of available authentication methods
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing users are not affected
5. **Improved Security**: Users can set passwords even after linking Google accounts

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Register a new account with email/password
2. Verify you can change password
3. Log out and log in with Google OAuth using the same email
4. Verify you can still change password
5. Verify both authentication methods work
